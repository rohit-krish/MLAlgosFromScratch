*Principal Component Analysis*

It is a process of figuring out the omst important features or principal components that has the most impact of the target variable

Using PCA causes the drop of accuracy

Scale features before applying PCA

it is a dimentionality reduction technique as it can help us reduce dimentsion

*_Applications_*
> Dimentionality reduction<br>
> Data visualisation<br>
> Feature Extraction<br>

*Things to learn before understanding PCA(ritvikmath)*

- Vector projections
- Eigenvalues & eigenvectors
- Lagrange multiples
- Derivatives of matrix
- Covariance matrix (in ritvikmath ther are 2 vidoes on this topic)
